    <h2> Impressionism </h2>
    <div>
      <p> Developed in the 1860s, impressionism is a very original representational painting style.
      </p>
      <p>It all started when artists rejected official government exhibits, called salons. At these salons, artists would come to present their artwork, typically realistic portraits of royalty, in hopes of becoming famous. Impressionists went against the tradition “smooth paint on canvas” and instead used light and “speckled” paint strokes to create more texture in the paintings. They painted what the eye would see; sparking light on the water, the orange flecks in the blue sky, and they decided to call it impressionism.
      </p>
      <p>Here are two very different styles of impressionist artwork: </p>
    </div>
    <h2> Claude Monet "Impression, Sunrise" - 1872 </h2>
    <div>
      <img src="https://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/first/impression/impression.jpg">
      <p>  In the first piece, you can notice how the artist (Claude Monet) used very light brush strokes, and many different colors to achieve the impressionist technique. There aren’t very many defined lines. Instead, he painted what the viewer would see, whereas realism is based on the exact dimensions of the object in front of you. Also, instead of using one large solid color to define an object, impressionists loved to depict colors from the scene that the traditional eye wouldn’t notice.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2> Georges Seurat "The Seine and la Grande Jatte" - 1888 </h2>
    <div>
      <img src="http://www.theartstory.org/images20/works/seurat_georges_3.jpg">
      <p> In this second photo, the artist uses dots to portray the scene. Many artists see the world as trillions of vibrating colored dots. Here, we can see what the artist really saw when he was looking at this sailboat in the lake. Most of Georges Seurat’s paintings use this method, showing us this is how he looked at the world, rather than the “realistic” someone else may see it. There is also an incredible amount of motion to be achieved when painting with the impressionist style.
