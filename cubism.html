    <h2> Cubism! </h2>
    <h2> Origin of Cubism </h2>
    <div>
      <p>In the years between 1907 and 1914, artists abandoned the idea of realism and instead decided to explore different forms of art. This is when cubism emerged as a new type of art form, and was originally influenced by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.  During the period of WWI, artists explored the use of non-art materials, such as newspapers, to make signs and inform people of current events. The cubists considered different color schemes, materials, and illusions in two different phases that are known as :
      <ul>
        <li> Analytical Cubsim </li>
        <li> Synthetic Cubism </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p> This is Picasso’s Maquette for Guitar, a sculpture made of cardboard, paper, string, and wire in 1912. This became the first sculpture assembled from disparate parts, meaning it was made from non-traditional art materials. This sculpture is so unique because instead of having one solid material surrounded by space, he integrates both space and material into a flowing sculpture.

    <h2> Georges Braque </h2>

      <p> The name "Cubism" was derived from remarks made by the painter Henri Matisse and critic Louis Vauxcelles, who described Braque's “Houses at L’Estaque” (1908) as composed of cubes. It was made to be non-representational art that was different than anything else. By using “cubes” and straight edges, they are able to create a unique art form that allows space to flow through the painting, as well as create detailed piercing figures.
