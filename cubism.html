<h2> Cubism </h2>
<div>
<p>
In the years between 1907 and 1914, artists abandoned the idea of realism and instead decided to explore different forms of art. This is when cubism emerged as a new type of art form, and was originally influenced by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. The name was derived from remarks made by the painter Henri Matisse and critic Louis Vauxcelles, who described Braque's “Houses at L’Estaque” (1908) as composed of cubes. It was made to be non-representational art that was different than anything else. By using “cubes” and straight edges, they are able to create a unique art form that allows space to flow through the painting, as well as create detailed piercing figures.
